# **Comments**

Very weak unit tests. This is an area to improve for the future. 
<br/>
Frontend was build to display functionality, so it might not be the most visually appealing.

At the end of the project I've felt that the class approach for the backend was not the best as it just made unit testing much harder than needed, but there was no time left to redo the project ðŸ˜”
